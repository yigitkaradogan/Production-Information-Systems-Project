# Production-Information-Systems-Project

In this project, we have undertaken the task of developing the MPS for the Appleâ€™s
MacBook Air and MacBook Pro notebooks starting from the beginning of July
until the end of September 2023. While doing so, we have first forecasted the
demand using the Seasonal Factors approach according to the historical demand
data given to us. After coming up with a reasonable forecasted demand data for
the third quarter of 2023, we have created a model to minimize the inventory, back
order, overtime and procurement costs. Finally, using the Gurobi Solver, we were
able to develop a complete MPS for weeks 1-13 which can be found in the further
sections of this report.
